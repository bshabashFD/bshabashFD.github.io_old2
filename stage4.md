## t-SNE vs PCA
Dimensionality reduction is a technique often employed for visualization purposes. The method of choice used to be Principle Component Analysis (PCA), but since its arrival on the scene, t-Distribution Stochastic Neighborhood Embedding (t-SNE) has been gaining popularity due to its improved performance in maintaining distance-based relationships between data points from the high dimensional space. 

However, while tSNE offers advantages in performance, its mode of operation prevents it from being used on train-test splits. tSNE requires the information for all data points at once, and rather than find a transformation like PCA, it simply finds an embedding in the low dimensional space which optimizes some loss function.

The methodology behind tSNE is explained extremely well in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJVL80Gg3lA) Google talk by its inventor Laurens van der Maaten. So I will skip into my proposed methodology to fix the issue. This blog post focuses on creating a reproducible wrapper around tSNE (using the scikit-learn implementation).


## The Methodology

tSNE works by finding an embedding in an $m$ dimensional space from an $n$ dimensional space (where $m \le n$). So let's ask ourselves, perhaps once the embedding is found, there is a linear mapping from the $n$ dimensional space to the $m$ dimensional space? In other words, for each dimension $i$ in the new $m$ dimensional space, is there a linear mapping:

$$x'_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + ... + \beta_n x_n$$

If such a mapping exists, then for a reduction to $m$ dimensional space, we could employ a linear regression to find this mapping.

To test this theory, we will first try to fit a linear model on a multi-dimensional dataset from `sklearn`. I have chosen the MNIST dataset as the example here since it has more than two classes, and requires no scaling (all dimensions are in the same scale).


We will start by importing everything we need:

```python
import numpy as np
import time
import plotly
import plotly.graph_objs as go
plotly.offline.init_notebook_mode(connected=False)
import pandas as pd

from sklearn.manifold import TSNE

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsRegressor
from sklearn.svm import LinearSVR


import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

%matplotlib inline

```
