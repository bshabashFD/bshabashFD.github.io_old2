<h1>Boris Shabash</h1>

<p> I've recieved my PhD in computing science from Simon Frase University in
2018, and have since been dedicated to a life-long learning of data science
and machine learning.</p>

<p> What facinates me most about machine learning is the ability of 
algorithms to aid humans in their decision making progress. We, as both
inidividuals and organizations, need algorithms to aid us in the decision-making
process and in processing large data, and machines need the human input for 
sanity tests and for analysis that can detect when the machine is wrong.</p>

<p> I don't see machines learning replacing humans, I see it working side
by side with us.</p>
